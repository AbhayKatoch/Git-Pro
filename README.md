# GitHub Finder - Angular Project

This repository contains the source code for the "GitHub Finder" project, an Angular application designed to interact with the GitHub API to fetch and display user profiles and repositories. The project demonstrates best practices in using Angular and RxJS, and is well-tested with Jasmine and the Angular Testing Library.

## About the Developer

Hello, I'm Abhay Katoch, an aspiring software developer with a passion for solving real-world problems through technology. I am particularly interested in front-end development and enjoy using Angular to build scalable and efficient applications. This project has been crafted with attention to detail, focusing on optimizing performance and ensuring code quality.

## Features

- **User Search**: Allows users to search for GitHub profiles using usernames.
- **Profile Details**: Displays detailed information about GitHub users including bio, location, and links to their profiles.
- **Repository Listing**: Shows paginated lists of user repositories with details like repository name and description.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures the application is accessible and functional across all devices.


### Running Tests

Execute the tests using Angular CLI:
```bash
ng test
```

This will run the unit tests using Jasmine and Angular Testing Library, verifying the functionality of the ApiService and its integration with the GitHub API.

## Test Cases

The application includes the following key test scenarios:
- **Service Creation**: Ensures that the `ApiService` is created successfully.
- **User Data Fetch**: Tests that the service fetches user data correctly using the GitHub API.
- **Repository Data Fetch**: Verifies that the service correctly fetches repository data for a specified user, handling pagination as expected.
- **Component Creation**: Ensure that the component is created successfully.

These tests help maintain the reliability of the application by ensuring that critical functionalities perform as expected even after changes within the application.
